Supressions:
1) Suppressed protected field text and value in the SpreadsheetCell class of the SpreadsheetEngine class library.
   As part of the assignment, these fields are required to be procted, and stylecop fumes that this is so.
   Also apart of the homework is magically getting rid of all stylecop warnings, hence for these two reasons I
   suppressed the warnings.
